<p>Today I will be presenting a poster at ECIR 2012 about a paper Katja Hofmann
and I have written.Â  The abstract and full paper are included below.</p>

The abstract:
<blockquote>
In recall-oriented search tasks retrieval systems are privy to a
greater amount of user feedback. In this paper we present a novel method of
combining relevance feedback with learning to rank. Our experiments use data
from the 2010 TREC Legal track to demonstrate that learning to rank can tune
relevance feedback to improve result rankings for specific queries, even with
limited amounts of user feedback.</blockquote>
