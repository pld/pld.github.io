<p>A couple months ago we opened up the Helioid development version to the
public, but have not yet announced it. We have recently migrated servers and
tweaked algorithms and have significantly improved the performance.  There is still a lot of work to be done but we believe this reflects a healthy starting point.

<p>The graphic below illustrates how you can use Helioid to go from a question or idea to a
organized lists of results that helps you build better search queries.</p>

<p>This version of Helioid is a meta-search engine offering <a
    href="http://www.helioid.com">category based personalization</a>. Below is
screenshot of the results after querying Helioid:</p>
