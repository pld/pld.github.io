CampusU was a Ruby on Rails (2.x) social network web application.  It had an integrated Flash visualization, visible as header in the below screen shot, which was coded in ActionScript and linked to the site through an XML based API.  Video uploading and encoding were handled through a custom built FFMPEG job scheduler plug-in.
