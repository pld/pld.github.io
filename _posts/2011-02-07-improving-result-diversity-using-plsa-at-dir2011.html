    paper</a> is available for download as well.</p>
<blockquote>IA-SELECT is a recently developed algorithm for increasing the
    diversity of a search result set by reordering an original document list
    based on manually generated clusters. In this paper we extend this approach
    to create a diversification framework in which arbitrary clustering methods
    can be used, and where the influence of clusters can be balanced against
    the original rank of documents. We study whether clusters that are
    automatically generated using probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA)
    can compete with manually created clusters, and investigate how balancing
    the influence of clusters and original document rank affects diversity
    scores. As there are currently few datasets for evaluating diversity, we
    develop a new dataset, which is released with this paper. Our results show
    that diversification using PLSA can improve diversity, but that there is a
    large gap in performance between automatically and manually created
    clusters.</blockquote>
