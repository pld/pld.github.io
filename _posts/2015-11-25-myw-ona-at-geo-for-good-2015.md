This past October I spoke on behalf of [Map Your World](http://mapyourworld.org/) at the 2015 [Geo for Good](http://geoforgood2015.earthoutreach.org/) User Summit.

Map Your World empowers youth to explore issues and ideas that matter - like clean drinking water, or food justice â€“ then write surveys, collect data, and create maps to make change in their communities.

Map Your World is powered by the [Ona](https://ona.io/) [API](https://api.ona.io/api/).

Below is a video of the talk I gave, which includes a clip from the film [The Revolutionary Optimists](http://revolutionaryoptimists.org/).
