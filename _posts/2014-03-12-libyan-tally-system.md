[Ona](https://ona.io), a company I co-founded, recently built the tallying
software used to aggregate votes in the Libyan
constitutional assembly elections.  These votes were cast
throughout the country, on off-shore oil rigs, and at international voting
centers throughout the world.

The Libyan [High National Election Commission](http://hnec.ly/) has generously made
the tally system software open source.  All application source code is on
[github](https://github.com/onaio/tally-system/), there is an
[overview](https://github.com/onaio/tally-system/tree/master/docs/overview) of
the tallying process, and additional [code documentation](
http://tally-system.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).  A description of the
technologies used is posted on the [Ona blog](http://blog.ona.io/).
