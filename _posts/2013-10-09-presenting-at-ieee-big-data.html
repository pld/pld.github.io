<p>Today Jon Sondag and I presented our paper on ADMM for Hadoop at the<a
  href="http://www.ischool.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2013/"> IEEE BigData 2013</a>
conference.</p>

<p>The paper describes our implementation of Boyd's ADMM algorithm in Hadoop Map
Reduce.  We talk about the statistical details of implementing ADMM as well as
the nuances of storing state on Hadoop.</p>

<p>In our presentation we present background on the data pipeline we have built at
Intent Media and motivate why a Hadoop Map Reduce job is the appropriate
run-time for us to use.  We mention the alternatives for building distributed
logistic regression models, such as sampling the data, <a
  href="https://mahout.apache.org/">Apache Mahout</a>, <a
  href="http://hunch.net/~vw/">Vowpal Wabbit</a>, and <a
  href="http://spark.incubator.apache.org/">Spark</a>.</p>

<p>We also discuss alternatives specifically designed for iterative computation
on Hadoop, such as <a href="http://code.google.com/p/haloop/">HaLoop</a> and <a
  href="http://www.iterativemapreduce.org/">Twister</a>.</p>

the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers Algorithm</a>.</p>

<p>The paper describes our open source Hadoop based implementation of the <a
href="https://github.com/intentmedia/admm">ADMM
algorithm</a> and how to use it to compute a
distributed logistic regression model.</p>
