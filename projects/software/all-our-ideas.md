All Our Ideas is a research project to develop a new form of social data  collection that combines the best features of quantitative and  qualitative methods. Using the power of the web, we are creating a data  collection tool that has the scale, speed, and quantification of a  survey while still allowing for new information to "bubble up" from  respondents as happens in interviews, participant observation, and focus  groups.
