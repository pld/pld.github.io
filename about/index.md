# About

I am a researcher and entrepreneur specializing in computer science and
artificial intelligence.

I am specifically interested in search, learning, and data mining using recent
research in information retrieval, machine learning, and natural language
processing.

Contact me via [peter@helioid.com](peter@helioid.com).

Open source software is available as [pld on github](https://github.com/pld).

We are building a collection of photos of artwork created by [Doris Lubell](http://www.dorislubell.org/).
