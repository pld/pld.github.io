<p>A couple of years ago (2005) the Rome Air Force Base sponsored research [1]
into de-anonymizing VoIP traffic. The researchers developed a modification to
the Linux Kernel which inserted a watermark into Skype VoIP traffic that is
passed through a low-latency anonymizing network. A 24-bit watermark is
inserted through the modulation of the inter-packet timing of data packets.
This is essentially the establishment of a covert channel through a timing
attack.</p>

<p>The attacker reads the probabilistically hidden bits in the traffic to
reconstruct and identify of the originating and terminating nodes of a VoIP
call. A defense against this would be to scrub your outgoing traffic to remove
the covert channel or increase the probability of error in bit recovery beyond
the acceptable rate. The attacker is not manipulating packets as they leave the
origin, since then they would presumably already know the origin. The suggested
implementation is to watermark packets as they transit through a VoIP gateway.
Because of this it is necessary to scrub packets beyond the gateway; after they
have been marked.</p>

<p>More interesting would be to alter the packet timing in a controlled manner
and embed bits of your choosing. If you had enough knowledge as to how bit
patterns are assigned to identities you could arbitrarily alter your identity
and pose as another. You could also add incorrect watermarks to random VoIP
traffic.</p>

<p>To detect a watermark you can exploit the embedding process. The technique
relies on existing latency in the VoIP calls and is able to function with
around 20ms - 30ms of latency by making a 3ms adjustment to packet arrival
times. A suggestion is to make the latency as low as possible therefore making
the existence of a watermark more detectable since the latency would need to be
adjusted to unexpected levels. It may not be feasible to keep low latency for a
long period of time but that would not necessarily be necessary. Latency could
intermittently be pushed to the lowest possible levels and a check for embedded
bits could be performed. The method uses the existing latency in the first
minutes of the call to determine what an acceptable level of latency to add is.
Exploiting this, the first minutes (or so) of the call could be made with high,
but still believable, latency so the attacker embeds bits with the appropriate
higher latency. Once a watermark has been embedded the latency could be
significantly reduced and the alteration of packet timing should be
noticeable.</p>

<p>Covert channels based on packet timing have many applications, beyond
de-anonymization, and could be made very difficult to detect. Steganographic
style embedding of traffic is a possibility as well as watermarking for
authentication purposes by the originating and terminating parties.</p>
