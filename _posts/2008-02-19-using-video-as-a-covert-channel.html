<p>With steganography being all the rage these days why not up the ante and use
video as a covert channel?  (I haven't looked around for this but I bet someone
else is already doing it.)  With all the bandwidth, and the data already being
put through some sort of transcoding, the opportunity to embed seems ripe.  I'm
not sure how this would work, but let's assume the process is: (a) hardware
camera, (b) software transcoding and compression of signal, (c) network
traversal, (d) software transcoding and decompression of data, (e) video
display.  We'll assume adding data before (b) and extracting data after (d)
will not work due to loss from the transcoding.  To do live video stego insert
a step between (b) and (c) to add data and between (c) and (d) to extract
data.  The method would be rather detectable.  A better solution may be to
drown yourself in transcoding and (de)compression code for a while and develop
a stego (or stego capable) codec or a stego module for either a specific
existing codec or any codec satisfying certain requirements.  (Do these exist
already?)</p>

<p>Embedding of small amounts of data should be difficult to detect.  A simple
(well, maybe) exercise would be to embed a chat in a video conference.  Binary
files, VoIP, other video conferences, multimedia files, or any sort of network
traffic are all nice things to be able to embed.</p>

<p>The hardest needle to find is the needle you're not looking for.</p>

<p>(Relatedly, it would be desirable to be able to determine if someone has
found your covert channel.  How or if this could be done using lacking some
sort of quantum crypto I'm not sure.  Use of an additional channel to influence
the convert channel in ways known by the covert parties might work but not be
provably correct.  The idea would be that when an ease dropper is present their
would be some impediment to making the expected change in the channel, similar
to quantum crypto.  Although, "some impediment" is pointlessly vague.)</p>
