# About

I am a researcher and entrepreneur specializing in computer science and
artificial intelligence.

I am specifically interested in applying recent
research in information retrieval, machine learning, and natural language
processing to search, learning, and data mining.

Open source software I have written is available as [pld on github](https://github.com/pld).

We are compiling photos of [Doris Lubell](
http://www.dorislubell.org/)'s artwork.
