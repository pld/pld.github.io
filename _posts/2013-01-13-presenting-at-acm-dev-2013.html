<p>The paper was coauthored with Prabhas Pokharel, Mark Johnston, and Vijay
Modi.  The abstract is below:</p>
<blockquote>Feedback based on real-time data is
    increasingly important for ICT-based interventions in the developing world.
    Applications such as facility inventories, summarization of patient data
    from community health workers, etc. need processes for analyzing and
    aggregating datasets that update over time. In order to facilitate such
    processes, we have created a modular web service for real-time data
    analysis: bamboo.</blockquote>
