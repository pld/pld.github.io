# About

I am a researcher and entrepreneur specializing in computer science and artificial intelligence.

Through real world products and published research, I apply information retrieval, machine learning, and natural language processing to search, learning, data mining, and international development.

I release open source software as [pld on github](https://github.com/pld).
