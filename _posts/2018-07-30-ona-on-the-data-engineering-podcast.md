I was recently interviewed by Tobias Macey for the Data Engineering Podcast, the podcast about modern data management. We talked about the history of Ona and some of the technical challenges we've had to address to build global data collection platforms in humanitarian, international development, and global health verticals. You can check it out [here](https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/episodepage/canopy-and-ona-with-peter-lubell-doughtie-episode-41).

> With the attention being paid to the systems that power large volumes of high velocity data it is easy to forget about the value of data collection at human scales. Ona is a company that is building technologies to support mobile data collection, analysis of the aggregated information, and user-friendly presentations. In this episode CTO Peter Lubell-Doughtie describes the architecture of the platform, the types of environments and use cases where it is being employed, and the value of small data.
