Multitarus was an Agent Communication Framework implemented in Java using
[ECJ](http://www.cs.gmu.edu/%7Eeclab/projects/ecj/).  Work was performed under
the direction of Nils Nilsson with input from John Koza.  A diagram showing
agent evolving a strategy is shown below.  Download the [multitarus

*Multitarus: Agent Communication Framework*

A multi-agent problem is described in which communication among the agents proves to be essential to its efficient solution. Genetic (Evolutionary) Programming is used to evolve agents that can solve the problem by communicating amongst each other.
