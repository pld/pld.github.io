About 5 years ago I was a researcher at Princeton and worked with Mitchell Duneier. We used historical text analysis to evaluate his thesis, it's great to see his book in print. To do part of the analysis I used Google's text n-gram data and a mix of [Python, awk, bash, and R scripts](https://github.com/pld/google_gram_tools).

Here's a [New York Time review](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/books/review/ghetto-by-mitchell-duneier.html) with more details on his work.
